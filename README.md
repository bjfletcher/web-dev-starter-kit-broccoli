# Getting Started

1. `make serve`

to start the web server on <a href="http://localhost:4200/">http://localhost:4200/</a> and watch for any changes to any of the development files.

2. `make open`

will open the web browser.

3. Enable LiveReload with the web browser (install the LiveReload extension if not installed)

4. Develop away. :)

To create a distribution:

`make build`

# Broccoli

The `Brocfile.js` file is well annotated with explanations of what the various things do.

# Makefile

The `Makefile` is just a simpler alternative to having a `Gruntfile.js` for task runners.
